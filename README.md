I use this script for updating my ubuntu installations.

## [backupper.sh](https://github.com/ibadusmani/linux-scripts/blob/master/backupper.sh)
I use this script to create a tarball backup of my website files and configs on a virtual server.

## [logcleaner.sh](https://github.com/ibadusmani/linux-scripts/blob/master/logcleaner.sh)
I use this script to remove un-necessary entries on the log file that i use to track visitors.
Usually these entries are the result of various webcrawlers crawling my website.
